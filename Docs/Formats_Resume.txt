Hi. It's Olganix.

After some stranges crashs or inifinilty loops of DragonBallXenoverse2 (Dbxv2) on trying to making stage objects, 
    and discovered there is Inverse Kinematic on skeletons files, I concluded the basic files aren't well full knowed.

after making my way to discovered file formats for map of havok file, I decided to apply it on emd, esk, ean, emb, emm, sds, emo ema, nsk to find what is not yet discovered. 
It's take me a wild because :
-I discovered there is parameters witch must be splitted because they have 2 or more behaviours
-and also because I tryed to get what some unknow parameter is for
-and also I try to resolve some strange padding to have perfect rebuild.

I have extended the work on all files of few games : SSSSS (Saint Seya), Sdbh (Super DragonBall Heroes), Sfiv (StreetFighter IV), SFxTK (StreetFighterxTekken).

I discovered a lots of things. hope that will be enought to avoid wrong reactions in game.
    But, not all unknow parameters are well unknow, also some padding.

 
So, in this file we will talk about file format works, 
    but also the unknow parameters, what I discovered about them without could mark as resolved. 
    if you are not afraid about c++ code, you could take a look on libxenoverse2 git. 

Knowed a parameter help to other conversion tools, when it could, to do a automatic fill it. 
For non automatic fill, that help user in xml version to fastly iddentify 
    what is to change to be accepted by the game  (by comparaison with original file of the game) 

SO, if you have a trouble with a modified file, the game don't accept it :
    -try to compare the Xml version with the original
    -read this file to know about unknow parameters and try things.
    -read in forum/discord if someone talk about this kind a trouble.


Notice: all complex format's files of the list could be colored/tagged by using XenoWxHexEditorColorMaker.exe and whHexEditor.
    Also, if you drag and drop a folder (with the xml version of files) on AnalyzeXml.exe, 
    you will have the list of all possibles values of a attribute of value by Xmlpath.   
    So if you want to help to find a unknow parameter, you have the tools for.
    If you discovered a things, try to give me the information, 
    I will could test on every file of games or/and add debug in Xml to valide a hypothsis.
     



******************************************************************************** common


-emo and ema are the old format of emd esk and nsk.

on most of files, there is what I call a "version" parameter. it's not totally sure, but :
  -it's look like having a relation with games's evolutions (same if the number don't have incrementation).
  -it's the same number on some related files (on differents file's formats)
  -it's look not be a values used in game, in sens about changing something (like gravity, or number of bninary's section). 
  it could/should be the id of the project. but not sure, also because someof files are shared between games.




******************************************************************************** sds

sds is a file witch list and defined shaderPrograms. 
A shaderProgram is the list of shaders used. 
In this games, there is 3 types of shaders :
-VertexShader ("vs"): it's a programs apply on each vertex of a object. you can use it to move the vertex position (like for animate some water), or calcul something for pixelShader
-PixelShader ("ps"): it's a programs apply on each pixel of the object after razterisation. 
    you can use it to define the final color of the pixel. you can use it to make light calculation or other stuff like using textures.
-GeometryShader ("cs"): is for making new polygones, duplicate some geometry, doing calculations for physics. it's a little more complexe and few used in the games, only for specials particules.


[Todo explain the sds]

About the prefect rebuild, one file on dbxv2 have a space at the end of a shaderprogram's name.
But in emm use it, you don't have the space. So the rebuild without the space is good also.



******************************************************************************** emb

Emb are pacakaged files, generally for textures, effect's files, or sds .

[Todo explain the Emb]

 

About the perfect rebuild, it's good on every files except for 10 files of SfxTk witch have too much padding with no reasons. Should be nothing problematic.
some emb files have inside some filenames with folders. We remove the path part and it didn't break the perfect rebuild. 

******************************************************************************** emm

Emm is a file format for Materials.

[Todo explain the Xml]

About the perfect rebuild, it's good on every files except for dbxv2 witch have old memory leak in some original game's files.
Apparently, when a version of a game's tool had changed, the memory was bad reaffected, so we see duplicated and truncated material's names.  
I think it's not a problem because more recent games don't have the problem.
So, you can consider the rebuild emm as good.  

also this file of dbxv1 are not emm , but emb (see inside the first tags) : 800_GGK_CSS.pbind.emm 810_GVG_FBL.pbind.emm 811_GVG_CBT.pbind.emm 820_GFR_EEG.pbind.emm, 
                                same for dbxv2 1520_KFL_GBU.pbind.emm, 1520_KFL_GBU.tbind.emm, 1521_KFL_GBR.pbind.emm, 1521_KFL_GBR.tbind.emm, 1522_KFL_RAB.pbind.emm  

******************************************************************************** nsk

nsk is a package of one emd and one esk. 
It's apparently only for stage models.

There is perfect rebuild on all files because new nskpack tool only binary split esk and emd.


******************************************************************************** emd

Emd are models, with définition of a geometry (vertex, faces/polygones) linked to skeleton's bones, materials and textures.

[Todo explain the Emd]

Perfect Rebuild is done on all files.



******************************************************************************** esk

Esk are skeleton for skinning object like characters, or Node hierarchy like to place stage's objects.
For more easely speaking, we will tallk about Bones, same in case of Nodes.

There is also esk inside ean, but with littles differences on transform definitions of bones, but it's the same code definition.  
There is also lot of similarity with skeleton definition of old format emo and ema.
 
(Notice: why stage's objects are on the middle of the scene ? because of precision of the floating number ("float") :
If you put them on theirs place by adding the position into vertex position, you will have less precision on small piece.) 




[Todo explain the esk]

You could see there is skeletonUniqueId, it's the same on same skeleton and  it's 0 for some esk with one bone/node, like for camera ean.


About strange behaviour, there is :
-I don't know why, but certain first bone don't have "child" at "0xFFFF" instead normal value (most of case "1").
    It's concern 39 files of dbvx2 esk (not esk in nks), and there is a lots of scd files in this list (but not scd is concerned, and also there is 2 normal esk).
    it's not the version of file, not unknow_0 to 3.
    in ean, there is 588 files concerned, it's also the case of flagD, or case flag="0" => (flagD == 0) && (FlagA || FlagB || Flagc == 0) ?
    but in esk, only 39,  flagD is 177 and all combinaison not work.
    apparently all child=0xFFFF have flag=0x1, but it's not the invese case.
    I didn't found a explanation => So I have to add a childIndex_is0xFFFF, to rebuild correctly.

-by looking some strange case about "parent" "child" "sibling" indexes to make a hierarchy, we discovered there is more than one hierarchy.
    [TODO talk about be careful on certain file, to redo the hierarchy after editing in blender, 3dsmax or some others dbxv2 tools. ]



about the perfect rebuild, 
    -there is 8 files of sdbh (look like SCTxx_Mxxxx.esk) witch have some "-0.0" change to "0.0" values on the duplicate root bone (the one we delete on xml because is more easier for modder)
    -there is also a big section with all 0 , on sdbh SNR00_00.esk. 
        -as the number of 0 is strange for the number of bones (same with padding considerations)
        -as the skeleton in the equivalent ean don't have this.
        -and as there is no differences* (in sens, no parameter with a special value to explain a new section) with others esk files. ( *except flag = 0, but in ean and others games, some of have flag=0 and no section)
        -[Todo test ingame the modified file]
         so we could considerate it's a error in creation of the game file. 
         


******************************************************************************** ean

Notice: the tools will try to have minimum* the first frame0, the last frame (duration - 1), keep frames ordered in time and remove keyframe up to duration. (*if there is minimum one keyframe)


-[todo talk about float imprecision when conversion into degree, because it's more easy for modders, but we try to keep radians to test perfect rebuild]
-[Todo talk about minimum things into keyframes, checks : reorder keyframe by time, add keyframe for (duration-1) , same for 0].
    
-there is also a wrong sibling on "light" bone on sdbh bcs17l03.ean, but  in dbxv2 BFpot04.esk there is light but correct sibling => skipped.
-there is too much padding on rebuilded sdbh bg_twn_anm.ean, and bg_twn_anm_taitli.ean. and the inverse on sdbh GTX_C00_T02_New1.ean, there is too much padding in original file, but the same case found (not having AnimNode or keyframesAnim) don't have padding. 




******************************************************************************** emo


-old model format, emd, esk and nsk replace it.


-for simplification color are in [0.0, 1.0], but that make trouble about perfect rebuild.
-strangely the paddingForCompressedVertex is incrementation in the file dbxv1 AFnmc01.emo
-todo complete.

-for perfect rebuild, still troubles :
    -there is something look like memory leaks on groupNames, as if in previous version of the game's tools, there is also materialName and something else (sssss, Sfiv).
    - ~50 files (sssss, Sfiv) have the wrong materialCount (generally 0, and sometime +1)
    -2 files have a padding 4 instead 16 after boneNames Sfiv GEN_01.obj.emo and GEN_01.shd.emo (not compatible with others way padding)
    -Sfiv JRI_04.obj.emo have a padding on Ik1 not at 0, may be old memory. and also ROS_01.obj.emo ROS_02.obj.emo and ROS_03.obj.emo don't respect the order unknow_inc in EMO Partgroup



******************************************************************************** ema

There is some material file, like SSSS ARG_00.mat.ema, use a boneIndex 0x2A = 42, but there is only 16 bones and also materials in ARG_00.emm. so we don't know what ref this case. but we have to keep refIndex in xml to get this case. 

Notice: the tools will try to have minimum* the first frame0, the last frame (duration - 1), keep frames ordered in time and remove keyframe up to duration. (*if there is minimum one keyframe) 

-timesByteSize in xml is keeped because of some SSSS and SFIv files witch didn't respect the rule depending of duration (duration = nbFrames, so if it's up to 0xFF = 255, need 16 bits).
    BUT, I test the rule to pass into 16 bits (same if timesByteSize is 8bits) to avoid crash or strange effects.

for perfect rebuild, there is padding trouble for SFiv 136 files, but having too much padding is not a big deal.
the second trouble is about SfxTekken's BFU_kouro_L.ema and MAD_LIG.ema, witch are lights, have a padding 64, but all light from dbvx2 don't have it, I prefer setup for dbxv2 and the most number cases.
  

******************************************************************************** spm


-spm have 3 type/flags : SPM (also a version with no tags), SPE, SPX



-TODO test spm
    A-test with 0000 instead of truncated part/memory leak. => 0 will desactivate the effect , no it's useless.
     
    
    -test if the dbxv2 accept old SPM.
        V-remove DSC (without change SPX -> SPE, and with) => successs, I don't know what is for Dsc, but it's didn't be needed, and effect like underwater still working.
            -dbxv1 version of AFmnc is SPE, and dbxv2 is SPX. main differencies is unk_20 and 21 u16="0x625" -> 0x122 , and +52 octets in unknowEnd (if no empty values) + Dsc.
              -0x625 = 11000100101 (inv16 : 0101 0010  0110 0000)
              -0x122 = 00100100010 (inv16 : 0010 0010  0001 0000)
        V-test to convert into SPE -> SPM 0x310 => no crash but is like if the game read value from others part.
            -unk_8_c 0xFFFF -> 0x0000 : same
            -unk_5 00001 -> 0000 : same
            -unk_8_e 00 00 00 00 -> 04 00 00 00 : same ...
            -unk_8_a_1_c to 00000000 : same
            -remove second section1 just in case.
            -put lots of  00000 at the end like for AFR.spm : same
            -copy the section1 part of AFR.spm : same 
            => SPM is not well readed by dbxv2 
            => we can't take Spm account for the size, or we have to test in the concerneded game. 
            
            
    -same test to remove some part on SPM to see if game crash
        -Bflnd, I have removed the bad  values started at 0x380 on both section1, change the size of Section1 in header (0x360) => crash
            -and after test to change the 0xFFFF to 0x0000 (like for smallest section1) on line 0x180, the game accept the file again
            => So with 0xFFFF, it's stilll need a part of the space between 0x380 and 0x470
            => the 0x00000000 overwrited on old memory are for desactivate the effects (taht why next values are not re writted, because useless)
        -Bflnd, I redo (keep 0xFFFF) with 0x3E0 = no crash. 0x3a0 = crash, 0x3C0 = no crash,  03b0 = crash
        - Notice: unk_8_c is sometime look for a part of float, => so there is something to activate it.
        
    V-retest allready done changed tags
    -add the part in unknowEnd witch activate postEffect. and get a name of each. 
    V-inversion values from underwater and air on
        -I tryed to switch Section1 order, same for DSC => do nothing
        -I switch the unk_11 value => that work. 
        -I also see there is more that 0x0 and 0x1 value for unk_11, but only in common.spm witch I didn't know is used by what. may be on some skill or demo.
        -I also try to search the value 0x1 in map file, to try to have more than one Section1 possibly activated, but I didn't found, so may be "underwater is 0x1", "air is 0x0" are hard coded ingame.   
    
    -desactivate everything (00 01) and add one by one, try to find witch unkonw parameters don't react. => classic but with a hole on water around character , like in xenoviewer (may be missing someting like a RTT ? ).
        -remove all weird datas (0x360) = no crash, -80 octects = no crash but all dark blue + artefact.
    
    -one test could be cool is to test (from normal spm file) : you force a color like for multiplyColor, and you try to setup , one by one, the unin16 to 0, to get the one witch active it
        -
    
    -TODO guess some values from the RenderDoc capture.
    
    -activate everything (00 01 -> FF FF), and change unknow parameter
    -when find something regroup tag by fonctionnalities (god ray, sun, light , shadows, etc ...). 


-unk_11 is a id for map file or game (linked to underwater vs air)
-unk_8_a_1_b_22 : shadow filtering factor (may be anisotropie bias) : 0 = hardEdge, 1 = normal blurred /filtering, 4 = most blured.
-unk_8_a_1_c it's a float
